# Week 2

This week I learned about how one would go about mapping the application through the use of tools known as spiders. There are various techniques in mapping applications that allow for various degrees of success in finding potentially vulnerable code.

The second part of the week was bypassing certain client side controls. This is the act of doing input validation through the client side and not the server side. There are various ways in client side validation can be done, though the end result is that the attacker will eventually bypass such mechanisms.
