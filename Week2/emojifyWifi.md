# Emojifying My Wifi

So I realized my phone can use an emoji as an SSID. This is neat and I'd like my wifi name (the 5Ghz one) to have it as well. This is the journey.

First thing I notices was a form that allowed for various inputs. This was the one the configured all the wifi access controls. Here we see the 5Ghz part. The name is currently set to "asdffdsa".

Then when we try and use an emoji that we copied to our clipboard (in this case it's satellite space station. 🛰)

We see that there is some kind of checks for types of characters used within SSIDs, this might be for a reason, here my hypothesis:

1. An emoji might break the firmware?
1. Its not to a certain IETF RFCs standards.
1. The above two points don't matter and they don't want any type of code being injected.

Given these, I think the first thing we can look for is possibly some sort of js script that is client side only. So after a little looking at the js pages that the router sent over I used the control+f feature to search for the term "ssid", after a lot of scanning through the 150 or so entries, I found something:

This seems to tell us that there is a client side check on the front end. If there wasn't, then the alert somehow came from the backend. We see that the check is doing a regex check for ascii values in the range of 0x20-0x7E.

One way to bypass this is to attempt and modify the JS, but an easier way is to use a proxy that has the ability to look through traffic. So lets see how emojies are set.

For this I searched the emoji through duckduckgo which is a common search engine. This will tell us how its encoded. With the request we see:

    Notice the Parameter:
    q=%F0%9F%9B%B0

This tells us how its encoded. So we can go into the router's wifi page and type:

![wifi placeholder](/Week2/img/changeNameTo.png)

This is a placeholder that passes the JS regex checks, we will intercept this and look for "aaaaaaaa1", the replace with the encoded emoji and see.

Then I populate it with the encoded emoji and get:

### Update:

The only thing known as of now is that the 2nd 5Ghz SSID doesn't seem to get checked, but the first one and the 2.4Ghz do get checked or they break, not sure why.
