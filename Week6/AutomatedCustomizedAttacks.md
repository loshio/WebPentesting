# Automated Customized Attacks

## Uses for Customized Automation

- Enumerating identifiers: Applications use many different identifiers for different aspects. Some of these include ones such as document session, item, and object identifiers. 
- Harvesting Data: Many vulnerabilities allow for extracting of data and thus allow an attacker into creating specific crafted requests and thus a need for automation.
- Web application fuzzing: this is the aspect of crafting requests into trying to get a different output that normal. This means finding a logic error of sorts that instead of giving a 403 giving a 405.
