# Access Controls

## Vertical and Horizontal Access Controls

There are two different types of access controls that are within applications, these two are vertical and horizontal.

#### Vertical

This is the access controls that doesn't allow a user to elevate privileges to a higher ranked user, such as admin.

#### Horizontal

This is the access controls that doesn't allow a user to access other users of the same level. This means that you have access to your social media account, but not others.



## Vertical Privilege Escalation

### Unprotected Functionality

Some sites may not have access controls on certain parts of the site such as www.example.com/admin. This is dangerous as it isn't protected. Some may try and obfuscate the URLs, but tools can brute-force them. Another way is looking for URLs in the code of the site.

### Parameter Based Access Controls
