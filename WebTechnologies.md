## HTTP

HTTP requests always have the same few elements in the first line. These are a verb that indicates the HTTP method, the next is the requested resource(URL), and finally is the HTTP Version used. Example below

    GET /test/myscript.php?q=123 HTTP/1.1

#### Interesting points of interest within a request:

    Referer: (misspelled intentionally) indicates the URL from which the request originated.

    User-Agent: information about the browser or client software. (Mozilla has been in nearly all since Netscape)

    Host: Specifies the hostname that appears in the full url. (In HTTP 1.1, Host is required)

    Cookie: Submits additional parameters that the server has issued to the client.

First Line of HTTP Responses include:

1. HTTP Version used.
1. Numerical Status Code (200, 404, 500, etc)
1. A textual "reason phrase" such as "ok"

#### Interesting points of interest within a HTTP Response:


HTTP has a few methods that can be used: (These are some but not all)

    GET         
        For retrieving resourse. Can be used to send parameters to requested resource in url query string. These URLS are displayed on screen and logged in various places (browser history, web server's access logs). Transmitted in the Referer header to other sites when external links are followed. (So don't use quesry strings for transmitting sensitive data).

    POST        
        Designed to perform actions. Request parameters cab both be sent in the URL query string and in the body of the message. Parameters will be excluded from logs and the Referer header.

    HEAD        
        Get request with no body. Can be used to check if a resource is present

    TRACE       
        Used for diagnostic purposes. Sends back exact same thing as the request to see if proxy changes anything.

    OPTIONS     
        Asks the server for HTTP methods available for a resource.

    PUT         
        Attempts to upload a specified resource to the server using the content contained in the body of the request. If method is enabled, then scripts may be uploaded and leveraged.

## URLs

Uniform Resource Locator

    protocol://hostname[:port]/[path/]file[?param=value]

The port number is optional and defaults to whatever the protocal specifies: 80 for HTTP, and 443 for HTTPS.

URLs may also be relative to a resource.

    /pathToScript/myScript.php

    test.ashx?uid=129

## REST

Representational state transfer (REST)

1. Requests and responses contain representations of the current state of the system’s resources
1. Rest-Style URLS usually means that instead of putting in queries within the query string, they are put in the file path.
