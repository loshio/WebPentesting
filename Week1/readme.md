# Week 1

This week I started to read the textbook. This involved reading chapters 1, 2, and 3. The first chapter was about INSERT SOMETHING. The second chapter was a bit more interesting as it talked about the mechanisms that prevent attacks. Finally the 3rd chapter was about the technologies involved within web development that a security researcher should focus on. These included certains frameworks and encoding schemes such as Unicode. But most importantly, I learned about HTTP as a whole and the various components involved. These included the methods, headers, format of requests, and an overview with HTTP responses.

I wrote notes on each chapter, though chapter 3 was the most as I knew most of chapter 1, a bit of chapter 2, and not much of chapter 3.
