## Chapter 1

There are no questions for this chapter in the book.

## Chapter 2

1. Why are an application’s mechanisms for handling user access only as
strong as the weakest of these components?
    - If you can bypass one, then you can exploit the next. This comes down to the sequetial filters that may be in use. If the one that is suppose to stop malicous text from entered data is bypassed, then it can bypass the ones not filtering for it.
1. What is the difference between a session and a session token?
    - A Session is an instance of a browser-server relationship in where the server tracks what the browser has done and who it is. A session token is an identifier for the session and is used for the browser to identify itself with the server. It does this by sending it with each request.
1. Why is it not always possible to use a whitelist-based approach to input validation?
    - When there are times where exceptions are present. The one listed in the text book is in regards to names. You may want to limit any symbols, but some people's name include apostrophes and hyphens.
1. You are attacking an application that implements an administrative function. You do not have any valid credentials to use the function. Why should you nevertheless pay close attention to it?
    - Access control may not be a thing, and the various methods on that admin page may be executed in some ways. Within the PortSwigger labs, this was done with using the "X-Original-URL" header.
1. An input validation mechanism designed to block cross-site scripting attacks performs the following sequence of steps on an item of input:
    1. Strip any ```<script>``` expressions that appear.
    1. Truncate the input to 50 characters.
    1. Remove any quotation marks within the input.
    1. URL-decode the input.
    1. If any items were deleted, return to step 1.
Can you bypass this validation mechanism to smuggle the following data past it?
    
    ```“><script>alert(“foo”)</script>```

**ANSWER:**

    - The first step may case sensitive, thus ScRiPt != script. This can be used.
    - You can URL encode all the nasty characters such as letters in "script" and the symbols. The 4th step URL decodes it, thus URL encode it, and it'll pass by. Just make sure to limit by 50 characters
    
    so:
        %22><%73cript>alert(%22foo%22)</%73cript>

## Chapter 3

1. What is the options method used for?
    - The options method is used for when finding out what HTTP methods are allowed like: GET and POST, but not PUT.
1. What are the If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match headers used for? Why might you be interested in these when attacking an application?
    - The headers are used for caching. The first checks whether the resource has changed since it was last cached. The second uses the ETAG (Entity Tag) to find out of the resource needs to be gotten again or it can use the same resource as last time.
1. What is the significance of the secure flag when a server sets a cookie?
    - The secure flag on a cookie means that the cookie can only be transported over HTTPS, never HTTP
1. What is the difference between the common status codes 301 and 302?
    - They are both relating to moving to a different path/URL, the difference between 301 and 302 is that with 301, the resource will always be located at the redirect. This means that the browser should always go to it when it goes back to it at a later date. The status code 302, means move just now, but later revert back to the original.
1. How does a browser interoperate with a web proxy when SSL is being used?
    - It can only operate at a strictly TCP relay, thus allowing for a handshake as usual.
